# esp32-ftms-server-ic7

This is an ESP-32 based ftms-sensor that I edited for my Schwinn IC7 bike. Originally built for [jamesjmtaylor's](https://github.com/jamesjmtaylor/esp32-ftms-server)
 stationary bike stand.  It uses the [Indoor Bike Data characteristic](https://www.bluetooth.com/wp-content/uploads/Sitecore-Media-Library/Gatt/Xml/Characteristics/org.bluetooth.characteristic.indoor_bike_data.xml) of the FTMS BLE service.
